# Guess-My-Number

This project takes a randomly generated number, asks the user to guess it, then manipulates the DOM via JavaScript to show whether or not the user has succeeded.

Scoring is as the following indicates: the player starts with 20 points, with each incorrect guess causing an infraction of 1 point. If the player's score reaches 0, they have lost the game and must start over. If the player guesses the secret number correctly, their score is considered final.

This project is currently being developed.
